    <p class="lead text-center">
        Good working relationships among various stakeholders are crucial to the successful performance of the Nyeri Chai Farmers Association (NCFA). 
        From information sharing to regular consultations, these relationships must be developed, managed, and sustained.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-5">Stakeholder Engagement</h2>
    <p>
        NCFA has involved various stakeholders in its operations at different levels of engagement. 
        **Traidcraft/Transform Trade** has been the only donor so far, providing material support to the Association.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the recently concluded project, NCFA partnered with the **Federation of Kenya Agricultural Farmers (KENAFF)** for implementation. 
        For its lobbying and advocacy work, the Association has initiated engagements with various stakeholders who are either currently supporting or have the potential to support the Association.
