    <!-- History Section -->
    <section id="history" class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="text-success">History and Achievements</h2>
        <p>NCFA was officially registered in September 2015 under the Societies Act. Its formation was the result of a series of meetings and consultations held by tea farmers from five tea factories in Nyeri County: Gathuthi, Ragati, Iriaini, Gitugi, and Chinga.</p>
        <p>Farmers came together because they felt their concerns and opinions were not being heard or addressed by the existing representation mechanism under the Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA). Despite KTDA's system of farmer representation, many farmers believed that their voices were not being effectively represented.</p>

        <p>In response, a small group of about thirty farmers initially formed the core of NCFA. Over time, many members dropped out due to the financial and logistical challenges, but a passionate group of about fifteen remained committed. This group shouldered the expenses of consultations, legal fees, and other associated costs out of their own pockets. Their boldness, vision, and dedication have sustained the Association to date.</p>
